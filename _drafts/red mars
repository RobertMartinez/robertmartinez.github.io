## Characters

* Nadia is a total badass. I've known people like that in the past and aspire to be like them. 

##  Closed systems ecology

Turns out, I am deeply interested in closed system life sustaining environments. I find this absolutely fascinating, and the stats are equally so. 

It takes 17.5 trees to sustain 1 human with enough oxygen. 
It takes 20 trees to remove enough CO2 to sustain 1 human.

The Biosphere experiments seemed like a great source of inspiration for KSR. 
Biosphere 2.2 was a complete shitshow. 

The equations are interesting, and I'd love to dive deeper into them.

##  Politics

Parts of this are so freaking burning man it's almost hard to read. 

Books most similar to this one that I recommend:
The Martian - Andy Weir

##  Misc thoughts

* If I were a STEM teacher of any kind I would totally teach most/all of The Martian. 
* Systems engineering is badass
