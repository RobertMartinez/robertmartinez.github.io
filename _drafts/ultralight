The benefits of going ultralight cascade.
If I had a nickel for every time someone said. "Is that really going to make a difference?"
Yes. It will. Not only will it decrease weight but these things will add up. Not to mention the things I decided not to pack at all. The decrease in weight translates to a decrease to pack volume, which will allow you to take a smaller pack, which will decrease weight further. You get to camp with fewer aches. Shoulders feel good. Back feels great. Energy levels high and spirits never teetered on the edge of insanity slogging that 50 pound pack up 1000m of elevation.
