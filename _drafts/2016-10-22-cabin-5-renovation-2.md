In my [previous post]() I detailed a project to renovate my cabin on a ship that spiraled into a poorly scoped, over-engineered effort that had essentially hit a dead end. My daily self-loathing at my own incompetence actually hit a steady state at some point over the next 3.5 years, which is as sad as it is unsettling. I don't ever want to think of myself as someone who 1) can't spec a project correctly (let alone a personal project) 2) start something I can't finish 3) ends up accepting the incomplete state. 

Well, consider this pity party over. I've finished my cabin. It's spectacular. I couldn't be happier. Let us all bask in the glory of the process. 

## The opportunity

In February Matt and I shut down SupplyBetter. I'll save my thoughts on that for a potential separate post. What matters is we're still good friends. I signed on with [Hammerhead](https://hammerhead.io), and gave myself the month of March to wrap up loose ends and get ready to start fresh in a new role. Of the many loose ends that come with shutting down your company, I decided that this was the only opportunity I was going to get to finish this project. Mentally, I was already in a state of catharthis from SupplyBetter, so I was primed to get through any emotional barriers previously keeping me from starting again. 

## Scope

This is the root directory of the Android ROM source code. If we get all the folders listed here along with their contents, then we are good.
