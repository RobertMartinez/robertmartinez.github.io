Two weeks ago I was painfully reclined on a couch, ice pack pressed against my lower back, wondering how moving a bucket of flour could have caused me such pain. While immobile my thoughts begain to drift, and I traced a rough chronology of all the times I had re-injured this specific area of my back. Hauling a dresser between apartments one year ago. Hoisting a sail on a friend's boat three years ago. Stuffing a crate of Anybots electronics into the back seat of a car four years ago. I wound time all the way back to the beginning and recalled the seemingly innocuous incident that started it all: a common rowing injury caused by taking a bad stroke in the tanks almost seven years ago. 

<blockquote>I knew I injured myself, but I didn't think it was serious</blockquote>

That particular practice Fall of senior year I knew I injured myself, but I didn't think it was serious. A twinge in the lower left back was practically fortunate compared to a [rib stress fracture](http://www.usrowing.org/safety/boathousedoc/bhdribstressfracture), [herniated disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation), or [degenerative disc disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disc_disease) -- all spectres that put a few too many of my friends into surgery and/or early retirement. I already had the beginning of tendonitis in my left wrist and signs of overuse in my right shoulder, so adding a new soft tissue injury to the mix just seemed to come with the territoy. No biggie. 

I couldn't have been more wrong. This area of my back has been a true annoyance for the better part of a decade now and it's time to do something about it. 

Here are my options:

* <del>Years of abject neglect</del>
* MRI/structured physical therapy (not while on "catastrophic" insurance)
* Self diagnosis/personal physical therapy
