COMMUNITY FOOD v.0.1: everyone should have just received a square cash invoice from eel.farts@gmail.com (yes, that's actually the email we're using for this). 

Here's the doc showing everyone's amounts and who has paid (which I will update as I receive payments). https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCe5C6LjfxU_i8LdRvWhYQwvDtNC4H6kiM-ppTF63XI/edit#gid=221763194

As discussed, if you need to be reimbursed for anything food-related, talk to Jeremy Guilloryâ€‹. He will handle that.
