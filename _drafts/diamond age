##Point

The Young Lady Illustrated Primer is an wonderful concept from Diamond Age. 
Lots of people have put in admirable effort to create the YLIP.
There's one front runner right now, but it's still extremely limited. 
The main challenge is not hardware. It's content. 

Where we are with content:

LeapFrog
Wikipedia
Khan Academy
Coursera

Here's to the future!
