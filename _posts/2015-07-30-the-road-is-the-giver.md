What if Cormac McCarthy's _The Road_ is a spiritual sequel to Lois Lowry's dystopian book _The Giver_?

While I typically steer clear of fan fiction theories <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>, I happened to read both these works for the first time within the span of a few months and thoroughly enjoy this idea. __Spoliers ahead.__

###Similarities that knit the two books together

####Characters
_The Giver_ leaves the reader with an image of Jonas, the male protagonist and newly establish guardian, sledding downhill with Gabriel, a small child scheduled to be euthanized. The Man and Boy characters in _The Road_ (an actual father and son duo) engage in a similar scene, except replace the Radio Flyer-esque sled and bucolic countryside snowfall with a rusted shopping cart and nuclear fallout. Many instances of parallel behavior occur between the two parental figures, so if you can get past the father/son discrepancy it's rather easy to imagine the Man's actions as Jonas'. 

####Plot
Both protagonists are searching for a distant land where things are better (somehow) than their current conditions. _The Giver_  calls this proverbial Canaan "Elsewhere" while the _The Road_ leaves the destination unnamed (consistent with the book's pervading theme of namelessness). This comparison certainly makes the transition between the two books easy to imagine. 

####Color
Both novels place great importance on the lack of color in their surrounding. Their worlds are ubiquitously gray, devoid of nature's myriad colors. At the end of _The Giver_, Jonas finds himself surrounding by colors, but with the sobering knowledge that the Giver lost his ability to see color once he gave all the color-related memories to Jonas. It's plausible then that _The Road_'s Man has simply given all of his memories to the Boy, relinquishing his ability to see color and returning to a bleak world absent of color. That, plus persistent nuclear winter obscuring the sun and destroying much of nature, of course. 

####Theme
Both novels are a rejection of dystopian societies. Granted, the communities in both worlds couldn't be portrayed in more disparate terms (e.g. a sedated functioning community vs. roving cannibalistic militias), but both are shown to be sources of safety -- at least relative to their surrounding environment. It just so happens that one group accomplishes this through exceptional isolationism and xenophobia while the other accomplishes relative safety by killing and eating everything that moves. 

###Why this theory makes both novels better

####Much needed character development for _The Road_
_The Road_ was a gripping read, but it took me an awfully long time to care about the main characters. _The Giver_ however, is focused heavily on making sure the reader is rooting for Jonas as a hero escaping from dystopia. I wanted so bady to believe that Jonas and Gabriel found refuge at the bottom of that snowy hill, but what if they didn't? What if the sled just came to a slow stop, like his first received memory? Imagine how terrified Jonas would be. That terror is very real throughout _The Road_, and the reader can immediately sympathize with the Man and Boy's harrowing struggle if you accept they've been in this situation for years. 

####Much needed nuance for _The Giver_
My main suspension of disbelief in _The Giver_ (aside from the completely unexplained ability of people to hoard/transmit memories), was that their community of "Sameness" could sustain itself as a purely dystopian society. The reader never gets an explanation of previous events that caused their community to be oppressed in this way. Of course, it's a young adult novel aimed at creating a definite hero protagonist acting against an obvious enemy during the hero's transition out of boyhood, but that's just not  compelling reading for an adult <a id="10" href="#11">[1]</a>. Now imagine this community formed its Rules while living in the post-apocalyptic world of _The Road_. Suddenly the community's ongoing abhorrent social actions (like euthanizing the very young and old) have a reason. Not enough to justify their ultra-draconion government, but considering the alternatives I can see a group of people making those decisions.

####Much needed internal conflict for the reader
The end of _The Giver_ leaves Jonas completing transition to adulthood - feeling free, responsible for another, uncertain-yet-optimistic about the future. Well, what if at the bottom of the hill he realizes that there are no lights and music. He and Gabe are alone, and worse still, that snow is actually nuclear fallout (but he didn't know because he only had memories of snow and couldn't conceive anything else). What a punch to the gut that would be for the reader. A brutal conclusion to Jonas' transition to adulthood with an important final question: was his decision to abandon his community the correct choice? Now all of the horrific encounters endured by the Man and Boy in _The Road_ have context, and much needed internal conflict for the reader as they wrestle with the question.

###Conclusion
I doubt Cormac McCarthy intended for his book to complement Lowry's young adult classic so thoroughly. However, I highly recommend those who have only read either _The Giver_ or _The Road_ to read the other book and entertain this theory. It's a brutal and unforgiving viewpoint, but one the enriches the experience of both. 

P.S. Ready for an M. Night Shyamalan-ian twist? The huntsman at the end of _The Road_ is the Giver who has reunited with Gabriel. Does it make any sense? Of course not, but wouldn't it be a cool way to wrap up both stories? 

<a id="01" href="#00">[0]</a> Though Rod Hilton's ["Machete Order"](http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/) recommendation for watching the Star Wars movies is brilliant.

<a id="11" href="#10">[1]</a> Of course, one could certainly argue that I shouldn't be reading YA novels to begin with if I hold this belief.
