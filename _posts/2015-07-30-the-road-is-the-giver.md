What if Cormac McCarthy's _The Road_ is a spiritual sequel to Lois Lowry's dystopian book _The Giver_?

I just so happened to read both these works for the first time within the span of a few months. While I typically steer clear of fan fiction theories <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>, I'm compelled to share mine. __Spoliers ahead.__

###Similarities that knit the two books together

####Characters
_The Giver_ leaves the reader with an image of Jonas, the male protagonist and newly establish guardian, sledding downhill with Gabriel, as small child scheduled to be euthanized. The Man and Boy characters in _The Road_ (actually father and son) engage in nearly this exact same scene, except replace the Radio Flyer-esque sled and bucolic countryside snowfall with a rusted shopping cart and nuclear fallout. Many such parallel behaviors occur between the two parental figures, so if you can get past the father/son discrepancy it's rather easy to imagine the Man's actions as Jonas'. 

####Plot
Both protagonists are searching for a distant land where things are better (somehow) than their current conditions. _The Giver_  calls this proverbial Canaan "Elsewhere" while the _The Road_ leaves the destination unnamed (consistent with the pervading theme of namelessness). It could very well have been that when the sled stopped at the bottom of that hill there was just nothing except for a road.

####Color
Both novels place great importance on the lack of color in their surrounding. Both worlds are ubiquitously gray, devoid of the myriad colors of nature. Now, at the end of _The Giver_ Jonas finds himself seeing color everywhere, but with the knowledge that the Giver lost his ability to see color once he gave all the color-related memories to Jonas. It could very well be that in _The Road_ the Man has simply given all of his memories to the Boy, relinquishing his ability to see color and returning his perceived world to bleak shades of gray. That, plus persistent nuclear winter obscuring the sun and destroying much of nature, of course. 

####Theme
Both novels are a rejection of dystopian societies. Granted, the communities in both worlds couldn't be portrayed in more disparate terms (e.g. a sedated functioning community vs. roving cannibalistic militias), but both are shown to be sources of safety -- at least relative to their surrounding environment. It just so happens that one group accomplishes this through exceptional isolationism and xenophobia while the other accomplishes relative safety by killing and eating everything that moves. It's worth noting that the Man never considers joining forces with the roadagents in _The Road_ (or any of the people he encounters), but his attitude is certainly understandable considering that he's been on the run for years.

###Why this theory makes both novels better

####Much needed character development for _The Road_
_The Road_ was a gripping read, but it took me an awfully long time to care about the main characters. _The Giver_ however, is focused heavily on making sure the reader is rooting for Jonas as a hero escaping from dystopia. I wanted so bady to believe that Jonas and Gabriel found refuge at the bottom of that snowy hill, but what if they didn't? What if the sled just came to a slow stop, like his first received memory? Imagine how terrified Jonas would be. That terror is very real throughout _The Road_, and the reader can immediately sympathize with the Man and Boy's harrowing struggle if you accept they've been in this situation for years. 

####Much needed nuance for _The Giver_
My main suspension of disbelief in _The Giver_ (aside from the completely unexplained ability of people to hoard/transmit memories), was that their community of "Sameness" could ever exist as a purely dystopian society. The reader never gets an explanation of previous events that caused their community to be oppressed in this way. Of course, it's a young adult novel aimed at creating a definite hero protagonist acting against an obvious enemy during his transition out of boyhood, but that's just not very compelling reading for an adult <a id="10" href="#11">[1]</a>. Now imagine this community formed its Rules while living in the post-apocalyptic world of _The Road_ (and existed long enough for the Man to abandon). Suddenly the community's ongoing abhorrent social actions (like euthanizing the very young and old) have an explanation. Not enough to clearly justify their ultra-draconion government, but markedly less evil when viewed through a lens of what their world has to offer as alternatives (e.g. roving cannibalistic militias, existence persistently on the precipice of starvation and freezing to death, etc). 

####Much needed internal conflict for the reader
The end of _The Giver_ leaves Jonas as having made his transition to adulthood - feeling free, responsible for another, uncertain-yet-optimistic about the future. Well what if when Jonas gets to the bottom of the hill he realizes that there are no lights and music. He and Gabe are alone, and worse still, that snow is actually nuclear fallout (but he didn't know because he only had memories of snow and couldn't conceive anything else). What a punch to the gut that would be for the reader. A brutal conclusion to Jonas' transition to adulthood with an important final question: was his decision to abandon his community the correct choice? Now all of the horrific encounters endured by the Man and Boy in _The Road_ have context, and much needed internal conflict for the reader. If Jonas had known just how terrible it was beyond the walls of his community, would he still have left? 

###Conclusion
Cormac McCarthy didn't intend for his book to complement Lowry's young adult classic so thoroughly <sup>[citation needed]</sup>. However, I highly recommend those who have only read either _The Giver_ or _The Road_ to read the other book and entertain this theory. It's a brutal and unforgiving viewpoint, but one the enriches te experience of both. 

P.S. Ready for an M. Night Shyamalan-ian twist? The huntsman at the end of _The Road_ is the Giver who has reunited with Gabriel. Does it make any sense? Of course not, but wouldn't it be a cool way to wrap up both stories? 

<a id="01" href="#00">[0]</a> Though Rod Hilton's ["Machete Order"](http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/) recommendation for watching the Star Wars movies is brilliant.

<a id="11" href="#10">[1]</a> Of course, one could certainly argue that I shouldn't be reading YA novels to begin with if I hold this belief.
