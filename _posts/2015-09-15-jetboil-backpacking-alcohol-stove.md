On our most recent trip it [got rather cold](robm.xyz/blog/backpacking-trip-weather-planning), so we were using my Jetboil Flash canister stove quite a bit to make hot tea (quite the welcome luxury). However, while we had boiling water available with minimal fuss, we burned through quite a bit of fuel. We actually got a little concerned we'd use up our two 100g canisters before the end of the trip, and that's when I realized I should have a backup stove source on hand. Thus, I set out to create a Jetboil backpacking alcohol stove. 

##Why an alcohol stove?

Everyone seems to have their favorite kind, but here's a quick rundown of all the different backpacking stove types to get a quick sense of what's out there:

* Liquid Fuel
* Canister
* Alcohol
* Wood-burning
* Esbit fuel tablets
* None! (aka "stoveless")

All I care about is boiling water, and to that end backpackers (especially [ultralight ones](http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/forums/thread_display.html?forum_thread_id=85277)) love to [mess around with alcohol stoves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2fPIvyme9I) to achieve this. In particular, the [Fancy Feast/Super Cat](http://andrewskurka.com/2011/how-to-make-a-fancy-feast-alcohol-stove/) seems to be the most common/cheapest kind, and it is ridiculously simple/lightweight. Seemed easy enough so I figured I'd give it a shot. 

##First attempt

After building the Fancy Feast, I tried it out with a Toaks 750ml mug. It was, to put it mildly, a failure.

Further research yielded another post by Andrew Skurka discussing the [limitations of the Super Cat/Fancy Feast setup](http://andrewskurka.com/2015/super-cat-fancy-feast-backpacking-alcohol-stove-flaws/). Takeaway: I need either a center-burning alcohol stove or a wider pot. Many varieties of either exist, but I decided to put the project on the backburner before spending more time on it. 

##Enter Jetboil MiniMo

REI used gear sales are wonderfully serendipitous, and on last weekend's event I picked up a Jetboil MiniMo pot (and only the pot) for $15. Here's why that's exciting:

###Advantages of pairing a Jetboil MiniMo with a Fancy Feast

* MiniMo is much wider and accomodates the Fancy Feast's side-burning flame configuration
* MiniMo flux ring is wider than the Flash's, which can accomodate the Fancy Feast perfectly
* MiniMo is backwards compatible with my Flash stove, so I can just swap the two pots before hitting the trail

Even better, I can easily remove all the parts that might potentially melt/burn on the MiniMo without any tools. Here's a before and after:

{% include image.html url="/images/jetboil-alcohol-stove-3.jpg" description="Fancy Feast stove sits nice and flush against the MiniMo pot bottom" %}

##Result

I was able to achieve a wonderfully clean burn with the denatured alcohol I used for the first test. The flame pattern seems to utilize the Jetboil's flux ring exactly the way I was hoping it would.

When I get around to it I'll be sure do some test boils and see how long it takes to boil up some water. For now, I'm satisfied with knowing that I can trivially convert my Jetboil to an alcohol stove with just a Fancy Feast and a few ounces of denatured alcohol.
