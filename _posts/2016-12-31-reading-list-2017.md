##  2017 Reading list

I read in bed at night. It's my surefire way to calm my mind so I can fall asleep. It's a bedtime ritual that has become more of a need than a convenience. An interesting side-effect here is that reading has become a need rather a convenience. This was not the case a few years ago, and I attribute this change almost entirely to my Kindle Paperwhite [0]. To get me excited for 2017, I've gone ahead and created a list of books I plan to read throughout the year. My plan is to follow a tactic I first heard about from the indomitable [Creon Levit](https://creonlevit.wordpress.com/2016/04/10/creons-advice-for-reading-and-enjoying-many-books/): pair a non-fiction selection with a fiction one so I can switch back and forth whenever I need a change. I could have used this when I tackled The Power Broker and got tired of reading it about 1/3 of the way through. 

This blog post is going to be a living document as I work through this list. My hypothethis is that I won't get through all 100% of the books listed here, but I think I'm at least setting myself up for success. What is success? Always having something interesting and compelling going through my mind before I fall asleep.

### Mornings
I've also added a step to my morning routine to include reading a snippet from any one of several different texts.

[0] The "almost" here is attributed to my undergrad years, where I unintentionally conditioned myself to fall asleep while reading. Sleep deprivation is a condition that shouldn't be ignored and I'm grateful I found a way to turn this condition into a strength.
