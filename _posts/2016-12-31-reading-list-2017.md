##  2017 Reading list

I read at night in bed. It's my surefire way to calm my mind down so I can fall asleep. It's a bedtime ritual that has become more of a need than a simple convenience. To get me excited for 2017, I've gone ahead and created a list of books I plan to read in 2017. My plan is to pair a non-fiction selection with a fiction one so I can switch back and forth whenever I need a change (this would have been incredibly useful for The Power Broker). This blog post is going to be a living document as I work through this list. My hypothethis is that I won't get through all 100% of the books listed here, but I think I'm at least setting myself up for success. What is success here? Always having something interesting and compelling going through my mind before I fall asleep.
