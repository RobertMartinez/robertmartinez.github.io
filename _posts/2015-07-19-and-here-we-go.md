I've known about using Github Pages to host a personal blog for quite some time, but it wasn't until I came upon [James Huang's post](http://growthalytics.com/programming/2015/07/19/setting-up-your-own-blog/) that I decided to set one up for myself (obligatory [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9913136) here). 

So why now? 

* I've been working on some exciting projects I'd like to share soon
* My previous attempts at setting up a blog have been fraught with dissatification
* I finally have a good enough grasp of Github, Jekyll, and Markdown to be technically competent
* The barrier to writing/posting using this medium is refreshingly low

Let's give it a go, shall we?
