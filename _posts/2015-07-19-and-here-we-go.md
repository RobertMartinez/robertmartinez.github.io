I've known about using Github Pages to host a personal blog for quite some time, but it wasn't until I came upon [James Huang's post](http://growthalytics.com/programming/2015/07/19/setting-up-your-own-blog/) that I decided to set one up for myself (obligatory [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9913136) here). 

So why now? 

* I've been working on some exciting projects I'd like to share soon
* My previous attempts at setting up a blog have been fraught with dissatification (e.g. Wordpress, Posterous, Posthaven, Medium, Blogger, Tumblr)
* I finally have a good enough grasp of Github, Jekyll, and Markdown to be technically competent
* The barrier to writing/posting using this medium is refreshingly low

Let's give it a go, shall we? 

###7-20-2015 Update###
 After I got everything up and running I discovered [Joshua Lande's post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole), which covers additional steps like adding comments, setting up a custom domain, and adding Google Analytics. The bit of advice I completely ignored was everything about Poole considering [Pixyll](http://Pixyll.com) covered that territory already.
