##Introduction
I've always struggled with running. Growing up, I hated any sport that made my body feel like a bouncing bucket of loose nails: every step a harsh, jolting impact on all my joints. Even while in peak physical condition rowing for Yale I would always grit my teeth whenever we ran. It simply felt incongruous to my nature. 

However, a few years ago I devoured [Born to Run](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189), and like any other 6'4" oaf I felt inpsired. What followed though were several years of on-again off-again attempts to transform this tragedy of limbs into a symphony of motion <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>. Finally, after injuring my knee on a run through Golden Gate park, I resolved once again that this very basic movement was simply not for me. 

##New strategy

In early 2015 I listened to the [Freakenomics podcast episode on temptation bundling](http://freakonomics.com/2015/03/13/when-willpower-isnt-enough-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast). In the episode they claim that taking something you enjoy doing (e.g. watching Netflix) and combining it exclusively with an undesirable activity (e.g. going to the gym) is a viable strategy for turning the undesirable activity into a habit. They present a compelling study, so I figured why not give it a shot?

##Bootie SF Mashups + Zombies, Run! = Success!

Typical tempation bundling is a 1:1 of enjoyable:unenjoyable, but I wanted to break out the big guns here. So I started out by combining the best of [Bootie SF Mashups](http://bootiemashup.com/blog/) with the running game [Zombies, Run!](https://zombiesrungame.com/).

It's a surprisingly addicting game in which you play a survivor of the zombie apocalypse (who doesn't love zombies?). Outrunning the undead is fun enough, but there's also a full radio drama that plays out with you as the central character. Each episode is broken down into sections interspaced with whichever playlist you want (which is where Bootie SF comes in). Toss in a shameless farmville-esque base-building mini game and you've got a rather compelling tempation bundle. 

After a few months I had quite the running streak under my belt, but I wasn't done. 

##Bundle-ception

Since all of my runs are out and back (and I have my phone on my anyways), I figured I could up the ante even more by tossing in [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/guide/).

Basically, there is a network of people who have hidden small containers (known as "caches") all around the world. There's nothing particularly exciting in a cache (often just a scrap of paper where you can sign your name), but the act of finding the cache is certainly the highlight. The creativity these folks display in choosing their hiding places is admirable. Commonly, locations are selected for their historical importance or aesthetics.

The best part is that Zombies, Run! even has a game called "Airdrop", which allows you to drop a pin on a map and the app creates a story to fit your run. This is a great excuse for me to introduce endless variety in my runs while maintaining a solid routine. 

##Conclusion

I definitely have not fallen in love running like the author of Born to Run. However, I don't hate it anymore and that's a considerable victory. Tempation bundling worked for me, and I can't wait to apply it to other aspects of my life.
