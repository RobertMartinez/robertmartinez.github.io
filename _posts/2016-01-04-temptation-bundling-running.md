##Introduction
I've always struggled with running. Growing up, I hated any sport that made my body feel like a bouncing bucket of loose nails: every step a harsh, jolting impact on all my joints. Even while in peak physical condition rowing for Yale I would always grit my teeth whenever we ran. It simply felt incongruous to my nature. 

However, a few years ago I devoured [Born to Run](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189), and like any other 6'4" oaf I felt inpsired. What followed though were several years of on-again off-again attempts to transform this tragedy of limbs into a symphony of motion <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>. Finally, after injuring my knee on a run through Golden Gate park, I resolved once again that this very basic movement was simply not for me. 

##New strategy

In early 2015 I listened to the [Freakenomics podcast episode on temptation bundling](http://freakonomics.com/2015/03/13/when-willpower-isnt-enough-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast). In the episode they claim that taking something you enjoy doing (e.g. watching Netflix) and combining it exclusively with an undesirable activity (e.g. going to the gym) is a viable strategy for turning the undesirable activity into a habit. They present a compelling study, so I figured why not give it a shot?

##Bootie SF Mashups + Zombies, Run! = Success!

Typical tempation bundling is a 1:1 of enjoyable:unenjoyable, so I started by listening to the best of [Bootie SF Mashups](http://bootiemashup.com/blog/). Every month they'd post the best mashups of the month, which I would promptly download and append my favorites to my running playlist. Now that I had an awesome mix, I would only allow myself to listen when I was running. Bam! Temptation bundled. 

But I wanted more. Enter the running game, [Zombies, Run!](https://zombiesrungame.com/).

It's a surprisingly addicting game in which you play a survivor of the zombie apocalypse (who doesn't love zombies?). Outrunning the undead is fun, but there's also a full radio drama that plays out with you as the central character. Each episode is broken down into sections interspaced with whichever playlist you want (e.g. Bootie SF). Toss in a shameless farmville-esque base-building mini game and I was tempation bundled hook, line, and sinker. After a few months I had quite the running streak under my belt.

But I wanted more. 

##Bundle-ception

Since all of my runs are out and back (and I have my phone on my anyways), I realized I could incorporate a completely different game into my runs while I play Zombies, Run!. This game is affectionately known as [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/guide/). 

{% include image.html url="/images/geocaching-2.png" description="A game of nerdy espionage." %}

Basically, there is a network of (real) people who have hidden (real) small containers (known as "caches") all around the (real) world. There's nothing particularly exciting in a cache (often just a scrap of paper where you can sign your name), but the act of finding the cache is the real highlight. The creativity these folks display in choosing their hiding places is admirable. Further, the locations selected are often chosen for their historical importance or aesthetics.

The best part is that Zombies, Run! is all setup to handle my game within a game. It has a mission category called "Airdrop", which allows you to drop a pin on a map and the app creates a story to fit your run. My runs now look like this: 

1. Open the Geocaching app to identify the location of a geocache
2. Open Zombies, Run!'s Airdrop map and drop a pin at the location
3. Play the Airdrop mision while also listening to Bootie SF mashups
4. Pause the Airdrop mission when I arrive at the location
5. Scour the scene for the hidden cache until it's found
6. Resume the mission and finish the run

This is a great excuse for me to introduce endless variety in my runs while maintaining a solid routine <a id="10" href="#11">[1]</a>. 

##Conclusion

I definitely have not fallen in love with running like Caballo Blanco or the other notable characters of Born to Run. However, I don't hate it anymore and I'm throughly addicted to a process that improves my life. That's a considerable victory. Tempation bundling worked for me in this case, and I can't wait to apply it to other aspects of my life.

<a id="01" href="#00">[0]</a> I'm going to skip the part where I bought some Vibrams and prompty injured my calves. I've encountered people who have become so smitten with the shoes that they now exclusively wear only that brand, but for me they've caused nothing but grief. 

<a id="11" href="#10">[1]</a> I confess that I don't include geocaching in 100% of my runs. It's definitely my ideal, but I sometimes don't have the extra 15-30 mins necessary to discover the hidden cache. Right now I'm considering it as a treat for when I do indeed have the time.
