Shenzhen is wonderful, but it has [significant air quality issues](http://aqicn.org/city/shenzhen). Coincidentally, our new apartment is in sore need of decorating. Enter solution: air-filtering house plants! 

In 1989, NASA published a study that identified chemicals harmful to humans in a closed environment and the plants that are most effective at filtering those substances out of the air. It also helps that these plants are very difficult to kill. I'm not on a space station, but I care about the air I breathe. Here is my process:

### Steps

* Pull up the NASA Clean Air Study to get the full list of plants - 31 total
* Filter out all the plants toxic to dogs (or other pets) - 12 plants remaining
* Filter for just the plants that can be sourced in SE Asia - 5 plants remaining <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>
* Verify that the remaining plants cover the spectrum of chemicals NASA identified as harmfaul - True!

##  Chemicals that are filtered:
* CO2
* Benzene
* Formaldehyde
* Trichloroethylene
* Xylene
* Toluene
* Ammonia

##  What's not filtered
These plants will _not_ filter out small particulate matter. The particulate matter that is of frequent concern is PM2.5, and these plants won't deal with that at all. I'll explore this later. 

## The short list 
(NASA approved, pet-owner approved plants that can be found in SE Asia)

* Liriope spicata (creeping lilyturf, monkey grass)
* Rhapis excelsa (Broadleaf Lady Palm)
* Phalaenopsis (moth orchids)
* Dendrobium (Noble Dendrobium Orchid)
* Gerbera jamesonii (Barberton daisy)

<a id="01" href="#00">[0]</a> There's actually one more plant I didn't include on the final list, which is the [Pygmy Date Palm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_roebelenii). As much as I would love to have one of these in my apartment (it's dog safe!), it's large enough to basically be a 3rd roommate.
