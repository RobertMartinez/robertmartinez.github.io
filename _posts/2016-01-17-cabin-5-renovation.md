As an engineer I get a profound satisfaction from finishing a well executed project. Similarly, when I am unable to bring a project of mine to conclusion (even a side project) the corresponding emotion can be equally strong, but in the opposite direction. I ran into just such a project a few years ago during the renovation of a cabin on a former cargo ferry. This project was poorly scoped, poorly executed, and I only had myself to blame. 

This is a cathartic story about a tremendous amount of effort put into bad engineering. 

Get ready for a train wreck. 

## The Problem

1. The cabin's bed is too small. I wanted at least a full size bed that could comfortable accomodate my and my girlfriend (primary).

2. There is a lot of unutilized space in the bulkhead (secondary).

Here are some wrinkles in the project:

- There are no given parallel surfaces or right angles.
- There is no such thing as "level" on a ship.
- Working space is incredibly tight. A standard 4x8' will not fit into the cabin.
- The next closest viable working space is up 2.5 flights of stairs (the last flight is a gangplank, which depending on the tide will either be a flight up or a flight down).
- I have none of the standard woodcutting tools one would use for a project like this (e.g. table saw, miter saw, jigsaw).
- The ship is a relateively high moisture environment.

## Mistake 1: Exploding the scope of the project

You'll notice from the picture that the slanted wall runs into the plane of the bed frame. If the scope of the project was simply to put in a full sized bed, I could have raised the plane of the bed by about 3 inches and built a custom bed frame to accommodate the mattress. Simple [0]. 

But I was having none of it. 

I was fixated on that starboard wall. How could <em>that</em> much space be unusable? I could help but obsess over how awesome the cabin could be if I could open it up and create functional shelving. It would turn the room from being claustrophobic into luxurious. It would feel like a Stateroom. 

So, like a captain entranced by a Siren's song, I decided to increase the scope of the project to include renovating the starboard wall. 

## Mistake 2: Not doing due diligence

I am not a ship builder. Before this project, I had zero experience with any kind of work (let alone engineering work) on ships. There were certainly resources available to me (the ship's owners and on-hand marine engineer to name a few), but I decided to act alone. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The way I saw it, I could just rip it all apart, take stock of the situation, and then form a plan from there. 

## Ripping it all apart

If you're at all interested in the process of carefully dismantling a wall, you can read all about it here. This is [my (now deserted) work report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18X-6gubn0JrHuOVNFaBCGCTXJB6Qd4sNYi_czuAFQZA/edit#) of my descent down the rabbit hole. I've included last picture of the dismantling so you can get a sense of what I uncovered.

Now that everything was exposed, I found out two crucial bits of information:

1. I did indeed find a bunch more space behind that wall. Super cool!
2. This wall is more complex than I was imagining.

## The plan

### First milestone: build the bed

{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-08.jpg" description="I decided to use the waterjet at the San Francisco Techshop to cut out my bed frame. Awesome decision and quite pleased with the results." %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-06.jpg" description="The negative of the part I cut out. " %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-07.jpg" description="The bed fits! It's brilliant!" %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-02.jpg" description="I designed this bed to be a semi-murphy bed. I'm able to fold up half of the bed frame so I can easily access the drawers underneath and total floorspace when I need to." %}


### Second milstone: build the shelving

{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-03.jpg" description="Nothing in this cabin is square. I needed a reference surface to base the best of my design, so i used my freshly-installed bed frame. " %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-01.png" description="First task was to build the cabin in CAD." %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-17.png" description="My shelving design, isometric view." %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-18.png" description="This top-down view of the shelving shows just how much of a jigsaw puzzle this is. That was the intent all along - build it all in CAD and then cut it all out in one go on the waterjet. Everything fits together like a jigsaw, requires minimal fastening, and is completely removable." %}

## Matterport Scan

{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-22.jpg" description="The folks at Matterport were kind enough to scan my cabin. Here is the raw scan." %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-19.jpg" description="I exported my CAD model as an STL and used Blender to superimpose the two 3D models on top of one another. Blue is the CAD model and Gray is the Matterport Scan." %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-20.jpg" description="Here you can see that while I was close, I wasn't close enough. There are some subtle-enough-to-easily-get-wrong mistakes in my CAD model." %}
{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-21.jpg" description="Here it becomes more evident where the thorniest issues are. This is going to be a huge pain to correct." %}

## So what's the plan now?

{% include image.html url="/images/cabin5-23.jpg" description="This is a scaffolding I tore down while dismantling the wall. As much as it pains me to write this, I think I'm just going to put this back up, though I need to rebuild it from scratch. " %}
