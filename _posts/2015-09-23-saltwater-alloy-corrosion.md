##What I'm testing
* Difference in corrosion rate 
* Difference in barnacle growth
* Ability of adhesive vinyl to remain attached
* Effect of adhesive vinyl
* Effect of mixed alloys (e.g. copper rivet)
* Effect of stamping (e.g the letters I stamped into the steel and brass pieces)

##Preparation

###Before submersion

###Test location
{% include image.html url="/images/saltwater-alloy-corrosion-9.jpg" description="MiniMo dissassembled" %}

##Hypotheses
* Steel rusts faster in air than submerged
* Steel grow barnacles first
* Aluminum grows any barnacles last
* Brass corrodes at the same rate

###Low tide exposed - one month
