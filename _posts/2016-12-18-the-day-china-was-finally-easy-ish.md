I was absolutely giddy on the train ride to Guangzhou for two reasons. The first: I was finally going to try out a custom-built road bike I put a deposit on two months ago <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>. The second reason: the train's speed. We were barrelling along at 305 km/hour (190 miles/hour). I had to peel my eyes away from the LED screen at the front of this immaculate train car to look out the window and appreciate the passing greenery.

## What makes China hard (an unordered list)

* Not knowing the language well enough to 1) ask for directions 2) convey what you need
* Not having a mainland bank account. This prevents you from using
  *  WeChat and Alipay (how people pay for everything out here.)
  *  Pretty much every store/shop that isn't a Starbucks other international chain
  *  Didi (which requires one of the above payment methods)
  *  Taobao or JD (if you want to take advantage of next day delivery, which is the norm)
* Not having a reliable VPN (if you use Google or Facebook products like gmail)
* Not having a power bank (your phone will _not_ last the day out there)


## Shenzhen to Guangzhou

<br>

Here's what I've learned about public transit in this part of China: they do not mess around. When you've got one [Special Economic Zone city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zones_of_China) 25% larger than New York City ([Shenzhen has 10.8M residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen)) this close to a city that's larger than [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania) ([Guangzhou has 13.1M residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou)), you've got to have efficient transportation. There are several different train lines that connect the two cities, and my route of choice this fine clear day was Shenzhen North station to Guangzhou South.

<br>

For a mere $10.71 USD I covered the equavalent distance of San Francisco to Santa Cruz in 37 minutes <a id="10" href="#11">[1]</a>. The equivalent public transportation option in the Bay Area is to...  good luck with that. The days of my sanity wasting away on sluggish Caltrain trips were a quickly fading memory. 

## Uni Town

{% include image.html url="/images/uni town guangzhou.png" description="A veritable island of athletes, or at least statues of them" %}
<br>

The bike shop was located on a peculiar little island affectionately called "Uni Town". An appropriate name considering the island is home to the [Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Higher_Education_Mega_Center). Concentric rings of streets emanate from the university's center, the outermost of which teems with pelatons of cyclists.

<br>

<br>

That outer ring is 16km (just sky of 10 mi), and perfect for an opportunity to try out my new bike. Summary: I love it and never want to leave this place. Alas, I had only planned for a day trip, so it was back in a cab to Guangzhou South to catch the bullet train back to Shenzhen. 

## Bonus Day! Dafen!

{% include image.html url="/images/dafen1.jpg" description="A typical shop in Dafen Oil Painting Village." %}
<br>

After the miraculous day trip that was Guangzhou, I had a surprise encore the following day. the previous week I commissioned a painting for the Hammerhead folks back in the New York office. Grizzly has in recent months become our unofficial Hardware team mascot, particularly this adorably helpless photo of her wearing an over-sized life jacket and booties. I just had to immortalize this precious beast in an oil painting for Christmas, and Dafen was just the place to do it. 

{% include image.html url="/images/dafen2-grizzly.jpg" description="The finished work, and the artists who worked on it. The paint was still drying on the edges as I picked it up." %}
<br>

What made this day stand out for me (and why I'm including it in this post) is how easy everything finally felt. Not only was I able to commission the cutest canine-aquatic themed oil painting this side of the Great Wall, I paid the down payment via WeChat transfer (like Apple wallet). The shop texted me when the painting was done, and I was able to get to/from the Village via Didi. For the unfamiliar, Didi is Uber, except [Didi bought out Uber](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/) earlier this year <a id="20" href="#21">[2]</a>. This was a necessary and hard fought China achievement and I was damn proud riding back from Dafen with little Grizzle's portrait in tow.

## Copy Mall

<br>

Finally, the Copy Mall. I got a WeChat from my tailor in Luohu that my dress pants were ready and I needed to come in for a fitting. I dropped the painting off at my apartment, picked up Elyse, and a few stops on the subway later we were in the infamous Copy Mall of Luohu ([Luohu Commercial City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luohu_Commercial_City), to be precise). This place is [noteable for a few reasons](https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/ShowUserReviews-g297415-d1590980-r386228999-Luohu_Commerical_City_Lo_Wu_Shopping_Plaza-Shenzhen_Guangdong.html), but the one I cared about was my new pants. Elyse, my expert in all things sartorial, came with to help me check the fit and suggest alterations. A few pins to take in the hips, a few chalk lines to mark the edits, and we were all set. Off to the gym to round out a fantastic weekend.

<a id="01" href="#00">[0]</a> It is rather difficult to find a bike in my size in China. This bike shop ended up importing a 59.5 cm Avanti frame for me and then building up the rest. I would have had it a month ago, but I splurged for a China-brand power meter that took another month. 

<a id="11" href="#10">[1]</a> 77 miles each if you drove in a car from A to B. You can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find such a relatable comparison. 

<a id="21" href="#20">[2]</a>Since that Techcrunch article broke in August, Didi has neutered Uber, so if you're going to get around you're forced into Didi (or a Mobike, more on that in another post). This is particularly difficult because you need 1) to have a China-only payment system setup (Alipay, WeChat, or mainland China debit card) and 2) you have to be able to tell the driver where you are located. It is required by Didi for drivers to call their passengers for every pickup. GPS out here is either poor or intentionally bad (more on that later), so you need to actually describe where you are to the driver. This language barrier has been just that, but Sunday I finally got it down. The little things are sometimes the big things.
