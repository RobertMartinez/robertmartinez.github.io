I was absolutely giddy on the train ride to Guangzhou for two reasons. The first: I was finally going to try out a custom-built road bike I had put a deposit on two months ago <a id="00" href="#01">[0]</a>. The second reason: the train's speed. We were barrelling along at 305 km/hour (190 miles/hour). I had to peel my eyes away from the LED screen at the front of our immaculate train car to actually look out the window and appreciate the scenery.

## Shenzhen to Guangzhou

<br>

Here's what I've learned about public transit in this part of China: they do not mess around. When you've got one [Special Economic Zone city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zones_of_China) 25% larger than New York City ([Shenzhen has 10.8M residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen))this close to a city that's larger than [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania) ([Guangzhou has 13.1M residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou)), you've got to have efficient transportation. There are several different train lines that connect the two cities, and my route of choice this fine clear day was Shenzhen North to Guangzhou South.

<br>

For a mere $10.71 USD I covered the equavalent distance of San Francisco to Santa Cruz in 37 minutes <a id="10" href="#11">[1]</a>. The equivalent public transportation option in the Bay Area is to...  good luck with that. The days of my sanity wasting away on sluggish Caltrain trips were a quickly fading memory. 

## Uni Town

<br>

The bike shop was located on a peculiar little island affectionately called "Uni Town". An appropriate name considering the island is home to the [Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Higher_Education_Mega_Center). Concentric rings of streets emenate from the university's center, the outer of which teems with pelatons of cyclists.

<br>

That outer ring is 16km (just sky of 10 mi), and perfect for an opportunity to try out my new bike. Summary: I love it and never want to leave. 

## Bonus Day! Dafen!

<br>

After the miraculous day trip that was Guangzhou, I got a surprise encore the following day. I commissioned a painting for the Hammerhead folks back in the New York office. Grizzly has become our unofficial Hardware team mascot, particularly this adorably helpless photo of her wearing an over-sized life jacket and booties. I just had to immortalize this precious beast in an oil painting for Christmas, and Dafen was just the place to do it.

<br>

Here's what made this day stand out for me (and why I'm considering a bonus day). Not only was I able to commission the cutest canine-aquatic themed oil painting this side of the Great Wall, I was able to get to/from the Village via Didi. For the unfamiliar, Didi is Uber, except [Didi bought out Uber earlier this year](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/). Since that Techcrunch article broke in August, Didi has neutered Uber, so if you're going to get around it's going to be with them (or a Mobike, more on that in another post). This was a necessary and hard fought China achievement and I was damn proud riding back from Dafen with little Grizzle's portrait in tow.

## Copy Mall

<br>

Finally, the Copy Mall. I got a WeChat from my tailor in Luohu that my dress pants were ready and I needed to come in for a fitting. I dropped the painting off at my apartment, and a few stops on the subway later Elyse and I were in the infamous Copy Mall of Luohu ([Luohu Commercial City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luohu_Commercial_City), actually). This place is noteable for a few reasons, but the one I cared about today is my new pants. Elyse, my expert in all things sartorial, came with to help me check the fit and suggest alterations. A few pins to take in the hips, a few chalk lines to mark the edits, and we were all set. Off to the gym to round out a fantastic weekend.

<a id="01" href="#00">[0]</a> It is rather difficult to find a bike in my size in China. This bike shop ended up importing a 59.5 cm Avanti frame for me and then building up the rest. I would have had it a month ago, but I splurged for a China-brand power meter which took another month. 

<a id="11" href="#10">[1]</a> 77 miles each if you drove in a car from A to B. You can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find such a relatable comparison.
