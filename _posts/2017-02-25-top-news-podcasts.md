>“Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.” -George Orwell

Quality news is very difficult to come by. At this point I only care about news that I consider to be: 

* credible 
* relevant 
* informative 
* without bias (or, at least, aware of its bias)

I already listen to [a lot of podcasts](http://adventurethy.me/recommendations/). The following selections are my port in the storm that is our current world. Every one a brief refuge into a place of sanity, reason, and much needed respect for the truth. I will add to this page as I find more.
